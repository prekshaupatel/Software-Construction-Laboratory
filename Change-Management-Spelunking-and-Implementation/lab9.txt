Question 1


To find the disk space used to represent the working directory:
   cd /u/cs/fac/eggert/src/gnu/emacs-CS-35L
   du -s --block-size=M
      509M	.
We see that 509M is the disk space used to represent the working directory.

To find the space used to represent the git repository
   cd /u/cs/fac/eggert/src/gnu/emacs-CS-35L/.git
   du -s --block-size=M
      350M	.
We see that 350M is used to represent the git repo.

To find the files taking up the most space in the repository:
   find . -type f -exec du -a {} + --block-size=M | sort -n -r | head -10
      311M	./objects/pack/pack-24e56b1749b9320c560213d9045fa6cee42b4174.pack
      24M	./objects/pack/pack-24e56b1749b9320c560213d9045fa6cee42b4174.idx
      8M	./objects/info/commit-graph
      7M	./gitk.cache
      1M	./packed-refs
      1M	./logs/refs/remotes/origin/scratch/tsdh-vc-list-files
      1M	./logs/refs/remotes/origin/scratch/ns/draw-to-bitmap
      1M	./logs/refs/remotes/origin/scratch/joaot/make-completion-at-point-function
      1M	./logs/refs/remotes/origin/scratch/jit-lock-antiblink-cleaned-up
      1M	./logs/refs/remotes/origin/scratch/fido-mode

We observe that ./objects/pack/pack-24e56b1749b9320c560213d9045fa6cee42b4174.pack is \
taking most of the space. This is because the packfile consist of several objects \
saved in a packfile to reduce the space taken by the smaller files. This also makes\
it more efficient.

Question 2


To find the number of local branches:
   git branch | wc -l
        176
We observe that 176 branches are local

To find the number of branches that are remote:
   git branch -r | wc -l
        177
We observe that 177 branches are remote

_______________________________________________________________________

Question 3


To find the number of remote repositories
   git remote | wc -l
        1
We see that there is 1 remote repository

To find where the remote repository is
   git remote -v
        origin	https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/emacs.git (fetch)
    	origin	https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/emacs.git (push)
We notice that it is at https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/emacs.git

Question 4

The ten local branches recently commited to are:
    git branch --sort=-committerdate | head -10
	  * master
	    scratch/joaot/make-completion-at-point-function
	    feature/windows-with-utils
	    scratch/completion-api
	    scratch/a-modest-completion-redesign-proposal
	    scratch/fido-mode
	    feature/gnus-select2
	    feature/extend_face_id
	    scratch/jit-lock-antiblink-cleaned-up
	    emacs-26

_______________________________________________________________________

Question 5

To find the number of commits in the master branch:
   git rev-list master | wc -l
        139583
There are 139583 commits in the master branch

________________________________________________________________________

Question 6

To find the number of total commits:
   git rev-list --all | wc -l
        143910

To find the percent of commits in the master branch:
   139583/143910 = 0.9699
   96.99%
________________________________________________________________________

Question 7

To find the authors of the most master branch commits after or in 2013:
   git rev-list --after='01-01-2013 00:00' --pretty="commits by "%an master |\
   grep '^commits by ' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -10
        3691 commits by Eli Zaretskii
	3647 commits by Glenn Morris
	3605 commits by Paul Eggert
	1806 commits by Lars Ingebrigtsen
	1784 commits by Stefan Monnier
	1571 commits by Michael Albinus
	 619 commits by Dmitry Gutov
	 576 commits by Noam Postavsky
	 471 commits by Alan Mackenzie
	 469 commits by Juri Linkov

Question 8

To observe the map:
   ssh -Y classael@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu
   cd /u/cs/fac/eggert/src/gnu/emacs-CS-35L
   gitk

The commits and there positions in the map are:

We notice that the branch 4ea37c2b8b0c5a68fde59770c3536195e0972217 \
(the earliest commit from the given set of commits) branched into 2 other\
branches: Branch A (977cd6cb28a37744966ec62f70cf62659f6f302a) and Branch B \
(625cee531623feddbe3174fad52c7db96ec60bb3). Both of these branches had more commits.\
then branch B was merged into Branch A. However, there were more commits made to both the \
branches and Branch B was again merged into branch A (abcb2e62dae6aa26308f7ac9efc89247f89cbe65).\
After more commits in both the branches, Branch B was again merged into branch A \
(98ac36efe4ce4bd3a0bca76fc73ce6c7abaa4371). This is the topmost commit from our list of commits.
