HW 8

______________________________________________________________________

Question 1

Yes, the network is still secure even if some other team is observing all the \
bytes going back and forth. The data they would get would be encrypted and it\
would not be possible to decrypt it without the required private key. So the\
network would still be safe.

1) Yes, the network is still secure. This is due to the fact that we already setup\
   key-based authenication using ssh-agent which does not require us to enter \
   our passphrase again. As a result we will not be entering our passphrase\
   after our intial client and server setup is completed. So, the network is\
   still secure, since other people do not have access to the private key\
   (and cannot decrypt it since they do not have the passphrase either).

   However, if they had my passphrase, they might be able to decrypt my private key\
   and use it. Luckily, they do not have the passphrase.

   Since they would have access to information regarding what we typed\
   it would give let them know what we were sending across. Using this information\
   and the encrypted code, they might be able to figure out the hash function.\
   However, that is far-fetched.

2) No, the network would not be secure. this is due to the fact that the other team\
   would have access to the the private and public keys and would easily be able\
   to decrypt the data from that point onwards.

Question 2

When we verify the signature we get the following output gpg:
     Signature made Mon 25 Nov 2019 09:16:03 PM PST using RSA key ID D50149F1
     gpg: Good signature from "preksha <prekshaupatel@gmail.com>"
     gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
     gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
     Primary key fingerprint: C1F4 183E C6DA D732 4CC6  E2A9 193B 2014 D501 49F1

gpg2 --verify command compares the signature by decryting it with the public key.\
This verifies that the signature was encrypted with the corresponding private key.\
However, it does not verify whether the public key actually belongs to me. This\
would be neccessary to verify the signature.

This problem can be solved by proving the ownership of the public key using\
digital certificates. A third party can keep track of who the public key\
belongs to.
